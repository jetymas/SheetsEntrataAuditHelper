# Popup UI Integration — Entrata Lease Audit Assistant

## Integration Status (as of 2025-04-18)

- The popup UI currently manages audit state, spreadsheet URL, and user controls (start/stop/skip).
- Status, record, and field info are displayed and updated in real time from background script messages.

## Next Integration Steps

- [ ] Integrate dynamic field info for current column module (A–AO) being audited, including user confirmation flows for columns like AO.
- [ ] Display column-specific messages or prompts when user confirmation is required (e.g., AO.js, or any column with `requiresUserConfirmation`).
- [ ] Ensure popup UI can trigger or display the verification dialog when prompted by the content script or background.
- [ ] Add UI feedback for successful/failed confirmation and allow comment input when skipping/flagging fields.

## Implementation Notes

- Field info (`fieldInfo`) and record info (`recordInfo`) are already present in the DOM and updated via `updateStatusUI` and message listeners.
- The popup currently does not display custom confirmation dialogs for user-required columns; this should be added.
- Coordination between content script, background, and popup is required for seamless user confirmation workflow.

### Tasks

- [ ] Wire up `popup.js` to invoke column-modules during audit start/stop/skip actions, integrating helpers.
- [ ] Implement spreadsheet URL validation and feedback in popup (unit tests for parsing and error states).
- [ ] Add Jest unit tests for `popup.js` logic, including button state changes and DOM updates.
- [ ] Implement and test user confirmation dialogs in popup for columns requiring verification (e.g., AO).
- [ ] Create E2E Puppeteer tests for popup UI flows (start audit, stop audit, skip record, confirmation dialog).
- [ ] Update documentation and README with popup UI integration details and usage.
