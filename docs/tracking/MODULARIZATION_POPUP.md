# Modularization & Cleanup: popup.mjs (2025-04-20)

## Summary

- Fully modularized popup logic: all UI-related code is now in `popup-ui.js`.
- Removed all stray code and duplicate export statements from `popup.mjs`.
- Resolved SyntaxError and ReferenceError issues from leftover UI code after the main function.
- Ensured only these lines remain after the main function:
  ```js
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", initPopup);
  globalThis.initPopup = initPopup;
  export default initPopup;
  export { initPopup };
  ```
- Removed unused variables `statusText` and `errorInfo` per ESLint warnings.
- All Jest tests now pass, including `popup.test.mjs`.

## Rationale

- Modularization improves maintainability and testability.
- Keeping only event and export statements at the end of `popup.mjs` ensures valid ES module syntax and prevents test failures.
- Removing unused variables keeps code clean and lint-free.

## Next Steps

- Continue addressing remaining lint warnings/errors as flagged by ESLint.
- Maintain this modular structure for future popup enhancements.
- Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰

## Change Log

- 2025-04-20: Final modularization, cleanup, and full test pass. Removed stray code and unused variables.
