# Debugging Entrata Audit Assistant Popup Logs

## Problem
No console logs from the popup script appear in the Chrome extension, even after confirming that the bundle is up to date and loaded in popup.html.

## Findings
- Adding an inline script to popup.html results in a CSP violation (no inline scripts allowed in Chrome extensions).
- The bundle is referenced correctly, but top-level logs do not appear, suggesting the bundle may not be executing at all or a fatal error occurs before any code runs.
- The only `[Entrata Audit]` log seen is from a module warning, indicating some bundle code executes.

## Next Steps
1. Remove the inline script from popup.html to resolve CSP errors.
2. Add a top-level console.log to popup.mjs to confirm the bundle is loaded.
3. Rebuild and reload the extension, then check the popup console for the new log.

## Tracking
- If the new log appears, the bundle is loaded and executing.
- If not, further investigation is needed into manifest, path, or fatal errors.

## Message Handling Architecture (2025-04-21)

- All popup-to-background message handling is centralized in `src/js/background.mjs`.
- No helper or worker files (e.g., `background-worker.mjs`, `background-shared.mjs`) define additional `chrome.runtime.onMessage` listeners or register handlers for popup-initiated messages.
- The recent fix (April 2025) ensures all popup actions (`START_AUDIT`, `stopAudit`, `skipRecord`, `getAuditState`) are handled in `background.mjs`, with `sendResponse` always called.
- This resolves the persistent `Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received.` warning in the popup.

## Debugging Session: April 21, 2025

### Visual/DevTools Findings
- **popup.html** loads without inline scripts; CSP is satisfied.
- `[Entrata Audit] Popup loaded` appears in the console; no errors or warnings present.
- Source tab shows all bundled and source files are present and loaded.
- Application tab: Service worker (`background.bundle.js`) is running and active; popup is a client.
- No manifest or security/cookie issues are present in the Application/Privacy tabs.

### no-start.log Review
- The previous error `Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received.` is **no longer present**.
- **New error:** `Failed to launch audit. Check Entrata tab.`
- Popup and background scripts are communicating and logging as intended.
- UI responds to user actions and updates status correctly.

### Insights
- The message port error is resolved by the recent handler fixes in `background.mjs`.
- The new blocker is the audit launch failingâ€”likely due to issues with Entrata tab creation, update, or messaging.

### Next Steps
- Investigate why audit launch fails:
  - Is tab creation or update failing?
  - Is the Entrata tab not being found or messaged correctly?
  - Add more detailed logging in background script for tab operations and error cases.

Good vibes!
