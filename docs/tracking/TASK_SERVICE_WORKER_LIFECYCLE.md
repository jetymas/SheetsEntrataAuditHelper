# Investigation: Service Worker/Background Script Lifecycle & Tab Loading Timing

## Objective
Determine if the background script (service worker) is being unloaded before the Entrata tab finishes loading, or if the tab never reaches 'complete' statusâ€”either of which would prevent the START_AUDIT message from being sent and could cause the port warning.

## Investigation Plan
1. **Check if service worker is still alive after tab creation:**
   - Add logging at the start and end of the onUpdated listener to detect if the listener is ever triggered.
   - Add a keep-alive mechanism (if needed) to ensure the service worker stays alive until the tab loads.

2. **Check if Entrata tab reaches 'complete' status:**
   - Log all invocations of the onUpdated listener and the status of the tab.
   - If the listener is never called, the tab may not be loading as expected or the listener is lost due to service worker unload.

3. **Check for race conditions:**
   - Confirm that the onUpdated listener is registered before any possibility of service worker shutdown.

## Next Steps
- Add detailed logging to background.mjs for service worker lifecycle and tab loading events.
- Test and capture logs to determine if/when the listener is triggered and if the tab reaches 'complete'.
- Update the main investigation tracking document with findings.

## Notes
- If the service worker is unloading too early, consider implementing a keep-alive workaround (e.g., using a dummy port connection from the content script or popup).
- If the tab never reaches 'complete', investigate possible causes (network, permissions, etc.).
