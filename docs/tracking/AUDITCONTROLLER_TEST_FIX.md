# AuditController Test Fix â€“ 2025-04-20

## Summary
- Resolved persistent test failure in `AuditController.test.mjs` where status was set to `"error"` instead of `"complete"`.
- The root cause was the fetch mock not returning the correct object structure (`{ headers, records }`), and mocks for `LeaseAudit` and `RenewalAudit` needed to be ES6 classes with prototype methods.
- All Jest tests now pass after these fixes.

## Key Changes
- Updated fetch mock to return `{ headers, records }` for data fetches.
- Mocked `LeaseAudit` and `RenewalAudit` as ES6 classes with prototype methods.
- Removed unused `eslint-disable-next-line` comments.
- Fixed single/double quote style in the fetch mock.

## Next Steps
- Continue addressing any remaining lint warnings/errors.
- Begin splitting up larger files for maintainability (see TODO.md for plan).
