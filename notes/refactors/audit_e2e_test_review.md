# Comprehensive Review Notes for audit.e2e.test.js

**Date:** 2025-04-18

## General Overview
- This file implements E2E tests for a Chrome extension audit flow using Puppeteer and Jest.
- It spins up a static server, launches a Chromium instance with the extension loaded, and interacts with both the popup and background pages.
- Mocks Google Sheets API requests and handles authentication stubbing.
- Includes utilities for screenshot capture on test failure and aggressive error handling for debugging.

## Deprecated or Redundant Segments
- There are duplicate blocks for identifying the extension ID and setting up the `sheetRequests` array. These should only occur once, inside the async callback of `server.listen`.
- Some error handling and logging could be streamlined for clarity.
- The use of `@ts-nocheck` is a workaround for type issues; ideally, type errors should be resolved or suppressed more locally.
- The `global.it` override for screenshot capture is clever but could be replaced with Jest lifecycle hooks for more idiomatic error handling.

## Opportunities for Streamlining
- Consolidate extension ID extraction and `sheetRequests` setup to avoid duplication.
- Move all Puppeteer `await` logic strictly inside async functions to avoid parse errors and future confusion.
- Replace the custom `global.it` override with `afterEach` or `afterAll` hooks for screenshots on failure.
- Consider extracting request interception and mocking logic into a helper function for improved readability.
- Use a single source of truth for timeouts and navigation settings.
- Remove unnecessary comments and commented-out code.
- Ensure all error messages are actionable and concise.

## Notable Design Decisions
- Uses a stub for `chrome.identity.getAuthToken` to bypass Google sign-in during tests.
- Aggressively mocks network requests, aborting on any unhandled requests for test reliability.
- Takes screenshots of all open pages on failure, improving post-mortem debugging.
- Sets up a local static server for reference web pages, ensuring test isolation.

## Potential Improvements
- Add more granular test cases for different Sheets API scenarios (error, partial data, etc.).
- Parameterize URLs and credentials to allow for easier future expansion.
- Consider using environment variables or config files for port numbers and paths.
- Add cleanup for screenshots and other artifacts between test runs.
- Use TypeScript types or JSDoc for better maintainability if possible.

## Next Steps
- Remove duplicate and deprecated code blocks.
- Refactor setup and teardown to use modern Jest idioms.
- Extract interception/mocking logic into helpers.
- Replace global overrides with lifecycle hooks.

**This file will be updated with more notes as the refactor proceeds.**

### Refactor Actions Taken
- Consolidated extension ID extraction and `sheetRequests` setup into single `beforeAll` async callback.
- Removed stray and duplicate code blocks causing parse errors (extra braces, top-level `await`).
- Deleted redundant Puppeteer launch options left outside any function.
- Ensured all `await` calls reside inside `async` functions.
- Cleaned up error-handling and logging sections for clarity.

### Refactor Next Steps
- Extract request interception and mocking logic into separate helper module.
- Replace `global.it` override with Jest `afterEach` hook to capture screenshots on failure.
- Refactor `takeScreenshotsOnFailure` into Jest lifecycle hook for consistency.
- Organize code into smaller modules: helpers, fixtures, and setup/teardown utilities.
- Run full E2E suite and verify all tests pass without hangs.
